# Gmail API Email Sender

This Python script demonstrates how to use the Gmail API to send emails using OAuth 2.0 for authentication. The script relies on Googleâ€™s API client libraries and requires setup with credentials and token files to function correctly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Google API client libraries
- OAuth 2.0 credentials from Google Cloud Console

## Setup

**Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have the required Python packages installed. You can install them using:

   ```bash
   poetry add google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client

# Setting Up Gmail API Credentials

To use the Gmail API in your project, follow these steps to obtain and configure your OAuth 2.0 credentials:

1. **Go to the Google Cloud Console:**
   - Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

2. **Create a New Project or Select an Existing Project:**
   - Click on the project dropdown in the top navigation bar.
   - Choose `New Project` to create a new one, or select an existing project from the list.

3. **Enable the Gmail API:**
   - In the left-hand menu, go to `APIs & Services` > `Library`.
   - Search for "Gmail API" and click on it.
   - Click the `Enable` button.

4. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:**
   - In the left-hand menu, go to `APIs & Services` > `Credentials`.
   - Click on `Create Credentials` and select `OAuth Client ID`.
   - If prompted, configure the OAuth consent screen with necessary details.
   - For `Application type`, select `desktop application`.
   - Set the `Authorized redirect URIs` according to your application's requirements.
   - Click `Create`.

5. **Download the Credentials:**
   - After creating the OAuth 2.0 Client ID, you will be provided with a `credentials.json` file.
   - Download this file to your local system.

6. **Place the `credentials.json` File:**
   - Move the downloaded `credentials.json` file to the `/code/app/` directory of your project.

Make sure to keep your `credentials.json` file secure and do not expose it publicly.



# Running the Script

When you run the script for the first time, it will prompt you to authorize access to your Google account. This process will generate a `token.json` file in the `/code/app/` directory, which will be used for future authentication.

## Run the Script

Execute the script using the following command:

```bash
python script_name.py
